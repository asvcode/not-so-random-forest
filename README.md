# Not So Random Forest

Automating large-scale urban tree monitoring

#### Abstract

Detect and identify tree species in street view imagery 

Trees are an important part of a city’s landscape, providing a variety of benefits. Maintaining a city’s tree cover is a costly affair, requiring thousands of volunteer hours and several hundred thousand dollars every year. **Not So Random Forest** is an AI platform that aims to solve this problem by automating large-scale urban tree monitoring. Using deep learning techniques on Google street view imagery, the platform enables, at the click of a button, rapid localization, species classification and health monitoring of trees on a city-wide scale. 

Because the availability of labeled tree imagery is limited, I build and train CNN models on hand-labeled tree images. Installation instructions and model description are given below.
